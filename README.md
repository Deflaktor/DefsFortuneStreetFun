## How to Build

### Prerequisites

- You need to have [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- You need to have [python](https://www.python.org/) installed (at least version 3.9)
  - During installation of python make sure to check the checkbox "Add Python to PATH"
- You need to have copy of Fortune Street or Boom Street (.iso or .wbfs). This file needs to be in the same directory as this script. Also make sure there is only one original iso/wbfs in this directory.

### Running the Build

1. Clone this repository using git to a simple path which does not contain special characters or spaces like C:\git\CustomStreetWorldTour
2. Put a vanilla Fortune Street or Boom Street (.iso or .wbfs) into the same path. The iso image should also not contain any special characters and no spaces.
2. Start the `build.bat` (windows) or `build.sh` (unix) file to run the build.
