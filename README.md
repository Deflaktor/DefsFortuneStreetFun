Custom Street World Tour is an easy-to-install map pack for Fortune Street and Boom Street containing over a hundred custom boards from the [Custom Street Board Repository](https://fortunestreetmodding.github.io/maps), some including custom music and backgrounds.

### Changes to Base Game

- Easy mode maps removed. Easy Mode and Standard Mode menus (aka mapsets) replaced with 'Official Boards' and 'Custom Boards'.
- Over 134 new maps (number gradually increasing with Development Build).
- Changed mapset 0 minigames to mapset 1 variants, as almost all maps on both mapsets are standard mode.
- Increased the memory the AI has for lookahead calculation from 64kB to 128kB. This makes more complex boards more stable.
- Tax Office price reduced from 10% to 5%.
- Home price increased per level from 30 to 60.
- Three Star Shop value change from 1000 to 500 and price changed from 200 to 100.
- All boards unlocked by default.
